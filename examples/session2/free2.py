##### EXERCISE #####
# Now you can freely use things you have learned so far.
# For example, use for loop to draw things with the turtle.
#
# Remember these turtle commands:
# t.left(90) or t.right(90)
# t.forward(50) or t.goto(100, 50)
# t.penup() or t.pendown()
# t.color("yellow")
#
# Also remember how the for loop was formed:
# for i in range (0, 10)
#   print i
#
# That will print numbers from 0 to 9

import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
