# Meet the turtle!

##### INFO #####
# We define a turtle here. In order to use it, we
# have to import it. We learn more about this later.
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.shape("turtle")

##### EXERCISE #####

# You can instruct the turtle to move around the screen.
# Below we are moving the Turtle to forward 100 pixels,
# turning it to left 90 degrees and
# moving it forward 50 pixels
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(50)

# Click 'run' and see what happens.
# After that move the turtle around. Do at least three
# turns and lines.
