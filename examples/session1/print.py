# Let's practice printing values

print "Welcome to study with Python..."

##### EXERCISE #####
# 1. Write on the next line a piece of code that prints your name to the console


# 2. If you want to print scandic letters you have to add u in front of the text.
# Take the '#' away from the line below, and click run.
# Make sure you don't leave any white space in the beginning of the line.

# print u"รครถ"

# 3. We can also print other things than text.
# Remove '#' from the beginning of the beginning of next lines
# and try running the code

# print 1 + 1
# print 100 + 50

# 4. Make more calculations. Print the result to the console and let the computer do the calculation.
# Whenever printing content to console remember to start the line with 'print'
# for example like this:

# print 1 + 2 or print 1 * 2

# a) calculate your age + your friends age


# b) choose number, multiply it with 10 and then multiply it with 3


# c) Make an equation of your own and print the result


# d) Try printing the result of 1/2. What do you notice? We'll fix this in next exercise.

# 5. One more exception in printing
# Try to print a combination of string and number. It's
# a) First try this:

# print  "You are number " 1

# b) Then try this:

# print  "You are number " + str(1)

# What did you notice?
