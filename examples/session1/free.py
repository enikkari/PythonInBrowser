##### EXERCISE #####
# Now you can freely use things you have learned so far.
# For example, use the turtle to draw the first letter of
# your name or other objects on the screen.
#
# Remember these turtle commands:
# t.left(90)
# t.right(90)
# t.forward(50)
#
# Other commands you can try:
# t.penup()
# t.pendown()
# t.goto(100, 50)
#
# Open the Turtle methods at the bottom of this page for even
# more commands.

import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
