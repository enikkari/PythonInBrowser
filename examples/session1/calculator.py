# Let's use code as our calculator

##### EXERCISE #####
# 1. On the previous exercise we noticed that division
# returned unexpected results. Try this calculation again:

print 1/2

# The result is like that because Python returns just the
# integer portion of the result if the factors are integers.

# 2. To make Python return the full decimal result, either
# the divisor or the dividend must be written with at least
# one decimal place. Try the next divisions for example:

# print 1.0/2.0
# print 2.5/5
# print 5/3.0

# 3. Can you figure out what the next mathematical operation
# does? Hint: Try changing the numbers.

# print 3.0 ** 2.0

# 4. What about this? Hint: this is related to division.
# Replace the first number with different numbers starting
# from one.

# print 4.0 % 3.0

# 5. There is even more mathematical functions available in
# the math library. You can load the library with the
# following line:

# import math

# You only need to do the import once, and after that you
# can access the library functions like below.
#
# The library contains among other things the square root
# function (sqrt is short for square root):

# print math.sqrt(9)

# The library provide also pi, sine, cosine and plenty other
# functions. Full list of all available functions:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

# print math.pi
# print math.sin(0.0)
# print math.cos(0.0)
