# Let's use code as our calculator

##### EXERCISE #####
# 1. Our code is trying to be really clever.
# On the previous exercise we gave numbers as integers
# and our code thought we wanted an integer back.
# Let's try again, and print the following results
print 1/2
print 1.0/2.0
print 1/2.0
print 1.0/2

# When using only integers in calculations python returns integers as a result.
# We can avoid that, and receive decimal answers
# by using one or more decimal numbers in calculations.

# 2. Now make your own equation with decimal numbers and print the result of it


# 3. Take '#' away and run your code. Try to understand what it does.
# print 3.0 ** 2.0

# 4. Take '#' away and run your code. Try to understand what it does.
# print 3.0 % 2.0

# TIP! If you don't figure exercises 3 and 4 out
# try changing the numbers and think again.
