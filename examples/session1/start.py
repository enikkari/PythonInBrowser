# Welcome to learn Python

##### GET STARTED #####
# Press 'Run'-button and see what happens

print "Hello world"

##### INFO #####
# What just happened was that the line 6 â€“ 'print "Hello world"' got processed.

# There are 3 significant areas in this coding environment: editor, canvas and console.
# Editor (this window) is where you write all the code.
# Canvas (white space on the right) is used for showing graphical output.
# Console (grey area on the right) is used for showing text output.

# The text in the editor that comes after '#' are comments.
# When the code of the editor runs (when you click the 'Run' button)
# all the lines which are NOT marked with '#' are processed.
# All the lines which are marked as comments with '#' are ignored.

# Every time you press 'Run' the code is processed
# and the output is shown in either canvas or console,
# or both, depending on the code.

##### EXERCISE #####
# Just to make you feel more comfortable with the environment,
# write something else instead "Hello world" on the line 6 and press 'Run' once again.
# Check that correct output is shown in the Console.

# Now you can move on the next exercise.
