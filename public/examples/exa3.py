# Let's use code as our calculator

# 1. So our code is trying to be really clever.
# Because we gave it integer it thinks we want integer back.
# Let's try again, print the result of 1.0/2.0


# 2. Now make your own equation and print the result of it


# 3. Use these  characters and try to understand what they do

# print 3.0 ** 2.0


# print 3.0 % 2.0

# If you don't figure it out try changing the numbers
