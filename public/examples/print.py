# Now we know how to print. Let's practice a bit more.

print "Welcome to study with Python..."

##### EXERCISE #####
# 1. Write on the next line a piece of code that prints your name to the console


# 2. If you want to print scandic letters you have to add u in front of the text.
# Take the '#' away from the line below, and click run.
# Make sure you don't leave any white space in the beginning of the line.
# print u"รครถ"

# 3. We can also print other things than text.
# Remove '#' from the beginning of the beginning of next lines
# and try running the code
# print 1 + 1
# print 100 + 50

# 4. Make more calculations. Print the result to the console and let the computer do the calculation.
# Whenever printing content to console remember to start the line with 'print'
# for example like this:
# print 1 + 2 or print 1 * 2

# a) calculate your age + your friends age


# b) choose number, multiply it with 10 and then multiply it with 3


# c) Make an equation of your own and print the result
