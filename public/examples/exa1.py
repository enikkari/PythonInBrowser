# Welcome to learn Python
# This is editor
# Press 'Run'-button and see what happens

print "Hello world"

# All the text in the editor that comes after '#' are comments.
# When the code in the editor runs (when you click the 'Run' button)
# all the lines which are marked as comments with '#' are ignored.
# Other lines are processed.

# There are 3 significant areas in this coding environment: editor, canvas and console.
# Editor (this window) is where you write all the code.
# Canvas (white space on the right) is used for showing the graphical output.
# Console (grey area on the right) is used for showing text output.

# Every time you press 'Run' the code is processed and the outputs are shown in either canvas or console, or both.

# Just to make you feel more comfortable with the environment, press 'Run' once again.
# Now you can move on the next exercise.
