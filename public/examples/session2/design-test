ROLES
- one of the teachers is the business/CEO
- one of the teachers is the customer
- one of the students is the designer (or two)
- everyone else is a programmer

The CEO sets the price for the products together with the team.
The customer pays or doesn't pay for the products. Or pays more or less.
The products are drawings or animations that the whole group creates (everyone works together, no competition)
The money is something we can agree with the teachers to be safe.
The challenge is to get as much money as possible => make a big profit
The cost is the time invested into it.

Crazy idea: if the business is not profitable, it stops (e.g. the teaching stops)
