# Exercise: Let's check if the computer can remember your name
# This can be done using a variable

# Write your name like this, but replace Tuomas with your own name.
name = "Tuomas"

# 'name' is a variable.
# '=' is used to assign a value to a variable.
# As the name says, the value of a variable can vary.
# "'Tuomas'" is a value that is assigned to the variable.
# When assigning text to a variable, it needs to be written in quotation marks.

# Your name will be printed in the console if you write down like this
print "Your name is: " + name

# ...and click 'Run' on the upper right corner.
# See, computer now remembers your name. It's been saved in a variable called 'name'.

# Now, let's change the contents of 'name' to something else.
# Write another name on line 5, after 'name' and '=', for example like this
# name = "Tiina". Don't change anything else.

# Click 'Run' again on the upper right corner and check what is printed on the console.

# Congratulations! You've just saved data in a variable and also changed its value.
# Variable is a very essential concept in programming.
